              <p>
                Cambodia&#39;s children face immense hardships every day. Many
                families live below the poverty line, forcing parents to seek
                work abroad to support their loved ones. Tragically, some never
                return, leaving their children in the care of elderly
                grandparents or relatives who can no longer provide for them. As
                a result, countless children are forced into child labor girls
                work as maids, while boys beg for money, raise animals, or
                collect recyclables just to survive.

                    Another challenge is the lack of education on family
                    planning. Many Cambodians marry young and struggle to
                    support their children financially and emotionally. Some
                    parents, overwhelmed by their circumstances, abandon their
                    newborns at hospitals or pagodas.

                  <p>
                    Others, suffering from terminal illnesses such as HIV,
                    cancer, or heart disease, pass away, leaving their children
                    vulnerable to child labor, human trafficking, and other
                    forms of exploitation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cambodia still bears the scars of past wars. Landmines left
                    behind continue to injure and kill innocent people, further
                    deepening the struggles of already vulnerable communities.
                    These children are in desperate need of help, love, and hope
                    for a better future.
